# A data story about Millennials! 
Born between 1980 and 1996 in a rapidly changing world, millennials have witnessed the world transcend like no other generation. Me along with two other curious millennials from UC Berkeley, dug into datasets from various reputed sources like US Census and Pew Research Center to come up with visuals that can paint a picture of the millennial lifestyle. We analysed data to create visualisations about their demographics, marriage and family preferences, housing and financial conditions, spending habits, etc.
